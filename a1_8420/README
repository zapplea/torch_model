package list:
 1. numpy/1.14.0
 2. pytorch/0.3.1.post2
 3. sklearn/0.19.dev0

GPU: all gpu when set nn_config['cuda'] to True and the pytorch can detect available gpu. The default gpu device is 0, and
can change the device to set nn_config['gpu'] to the gpu device number available.

program instruction:
TODO: Normalize the data
The performance of the module is not stable. To get the best performance, you may need to run it several times.
The best accuracy and f1 is 96.77%, when test written independent data. And this happens when loss is NaN
which might mean loss is a absolutely small value.
