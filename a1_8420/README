package list:
 1. numpy/1.14.0
 2. pytorch/0.3.1.post2
 3. sklearn/0.19.dev0

GPU: all gpu when set nn_config['cuda'] to True and the pytorch can detect available gpu. The default gpu device is 0, and
can change the device to set nn_config['gpu'] to the gpu device number available.

program instruction:
for cascading network, sometimes the loss might be NaN, when it happen, please run the program again.
The performance of the module is not stable, the best accuracy is 96.7% when test written independent data.
